# Credit Risk Prediction Model Used to find Default cases

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a prediction model, detailing the steps taken to process data, build the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Description

The `prediction-checkpoint.ipynb` notebook includes comprehensive steps involved in:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Model building and training.
- Evaluation of the model with various metrics.
- Visualization of results to interpret the effectiveness of the model.

## Features

- **Detailed Implementation:** Each step in the notebook is well-documented with markdown cells explaining the logic and code cells showing the execution.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots for better understanding and analysis of the data and results.
- **Modular Design:** The code is structured in a way that allows easy modification to adapt to different datasets or model requirements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to run the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Libraries: (list all libraries used, e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn)
